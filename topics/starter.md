# Setting Up OrbStack

The only thing we need to download before starting is <a href="https://orbstack.dev/download">OrbStack.</a>
<br><br>Once you have OrbStack installed and opened, you'll be prompted with a "What would you like to do with this program" type message.
</br></br>
Nothing you select here will lock you out of anything else, it is meant more for a sort of tour of what OrbStack can do. You can select "Docker" and move on. Your screen should look something like this:

<tip>OrbStack is a tool that involves using VMs, Docker containers, and Kubernetes clusters. It is a great tool for learning how these things work.</tip>
